def sd(x):#simple x degrees like at the start of the problem and how many flips needed - also need to think of a way to store these values and compute them
    #make a list of icing from one point ot another which is face up
    icingFU = [[0,360]] # icing face up
    icingFD = []#icing face down
    #then need to compute an effect a certain degree has
    CD = 0 # current degree

#isolate and rotate about midpoint and hopefully can transfer one unit from one list to another
#also need to reverse numbers and such and such but seems to be a computation that cam be solvee
