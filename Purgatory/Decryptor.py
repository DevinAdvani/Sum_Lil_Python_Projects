#ASSUMPTIONS
#ONE HAS BEEN GIVEN THE LETTER 'E'
#THE SENTENCE IS COMPRISED OF ONLY PROPER WORDS
#THE SENTENCE IS LONG ENOUGH
#THE CODE CONTAINS AN E

#Inputs
code = input("INPUT CODE IN LOWER CASE: ")
E = input("WHAT DOES 'E' ENCRYPT INTO: ")

#Find a letter that reverse codes into 'E'



#break string into list

#search for the reverse E

#check every possible word and create a new key

#Then do that for the rest until the whole sentence is translated into proper letters
