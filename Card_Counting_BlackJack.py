#Explanation of Card Counting
print("""I thought it would be cool to have automate a type of card counting.
When the card total is greater than 11, there is a chance that when one hits, one will be greater than 21.
At moments like this, if the chance of not going bust is greater than 50%, one should do that.
This program does this
